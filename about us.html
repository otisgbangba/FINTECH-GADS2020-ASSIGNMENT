 <h4>My Name</h4>
      <p><big>Bus ticket booking during the offline era posed various difficulties to the customers as well as the bus operators.
Offline ticket booking reduced the scope of customers to choose different options based on their travel criterion
(Gayathry, 2013). It also increased the franchising cost for the bus operators. At the same time, the bus operators
were also finding it difficult to monitor their bus seat filling information. Many small and medium bus service
organizations do not have their own online bus ticket booking system. Online Bus ticketing system web portal is
a total internet ticketing operations offering the benefit of total in-house management of bus schedules, ticket
bookings, ticket sales, report generation, and other business functions associated with ticket sales (Melisa, 2007).
It also offers the power of decision making to customers to make a ticket booking through bus operators’
popularity, performance and ranking. This powerful Internet based ticket booking system that allows a full
control of not only on the ticketing inventory, but also the site’s content.
According to Melisa (2007), stated the basic components of an Online Bus Ticketing System web portal
that provides enhanced service to the bus operators and customers consist of the following:
• Capture of customer information such as name, address, phone number and e-mail address
• Price list
• Bus operators ranking
• Seating chart
• Loyalty Points/Redemption
• Search engine
• Payment information
• Organization's advertisement/slogan, phone number, fax number, and address
• Comments and suggestions section / option
• Reports</big>  </p>
